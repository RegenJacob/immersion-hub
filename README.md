# Immersion Hub

## What is Immersion Hub?

Immersion Hub is a web application for people who'd like to learn any language and keep track of it with different and cool features. 

For example, you have a problem keeping focused, Immersion Hub offers you a Stopwatch to keep track of your different types of learning like reading or listening and rewards you with some awesome **{{ currency }}** (We don't have a currency name yet :D)

## When will be Immersion Hub released?

[Vojjtar](https://github.com/vojjtar) and [I](https://github.com/mweiner01) are working on this project. It takes a while, please keep patient! :)

But: This could change at some time, that I will get someone else in my team who will help to develop the web application
